# Kaggle Make-Data-Count - Finding-Data-References Bronze (My Solution)

## Overview
This repository showcases my solution for the Kaggle competition “Make Data Count - Finding Data References.” The challenge is to detect mentions of datasets in scientific papers and categorize them as Primary (created by the authors for the study) or Secondary (reused from existing sources).

## Goal
The objective of this project is to develop a robust pipeline that:
* Reads and analyzes scientific papers in PDF and XML format.
* Detects references to datasets, including DOIs, repository names, and accession numbers.
* Categorizes each dataset mention as Primary or Secondary.
* Generates output in the required submission format (article_id, dataset_id, type).
