# kaggle-Make-Data-Count---Finding-Data-References-bronze
- kaggle competition 116/1282 solution
- This repository contains my solution for the Kaggle competition "Make Data Count - Finding Data References." The goal of the competition is to identify data citations in scientific papers and classify them as Primary (generated by the study) or Secondary (reused from existing sources).

## Competion Overview
Make Data Count (MDC) aims to measure the value of scientific data by linking papers to the data they use. Current links are incomplete, so this competition seeks models that can automatically find and add high-quality, contextual data-to-paper connections to the MDC Data Citation Corpus.

## Competion Goal
Identify all data citations in scientific papers and classify them as:
- Primary: Data generated specifically for the study
- Secondary: Data reused or derived from existing sources


## Data
- The full dataset is not included in this repository due to its large size.
